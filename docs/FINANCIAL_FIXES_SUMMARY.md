## Detailed Fixes

### 1. Invoice Number Sequencing Race Condition ✅

**Problem:** Concurrent requests could generate duplicate invoice numbers, violating CRA sequential numbering requirements.

**Solution:**
- Retry logic with 5 attempts
- Exponential backoff (10ms × attempt)
- Duplicate detection before returning
- Fallback to timestamp-based numbering
- Changed sorting from `invoiceNumber` to `createdAt`

**File:** `src/services/invoice.service.ts:956-1002`

**Impact:** Prevents regulatory compliance violations

---

### 2. Refund Overpayment Vulnerability ✅

**Problem:** Validated refunds against `payment.amount` instead of `payment.netAmount`, allowing refunds of processor fees.

**Solution:**
- Changed validation to use `netAmount ?? amount`
- Added detailed error messages showing fee breakdown
- **BONUS:** Fixed missing invoice balance updates during refunds
- Proper Decimal arithmetic for balance calculations

**Files:**
- `src/services/payment.service.ts:568-576` (validation)
- `src/services/payment.service.ts:619-634` (balance update)

**Impact:** Prevents direct financial loss from over-refunding

---

### 3. Journal Entry Floating Point Precision ✅

**Problem:** Used JavaScript number arithmetic for debit/credit totals, risking precision errors in double-entry bookkeeping.

**Solution:**
- Imported `decimal.js` library
- Replaced all `+` operations with `Decimal.plus()`
- Use `Decimal.greaterThan()`, `.minus()`, `.abs()` for comparisons
- Convert to string when creating Prisma.Decimal

**File:** `src/services/journal.service.ts:1-106`

**Impact:** Ensures double-entry accounting precision

---

### 4. Hard Delete of Invoice Items ✅

**Problem:** Used `deleteMany()` to hard-delete invoice items, violating financial record immutability.

**Complete Solution:**
- **Schema Changes:** Added version control fields
  - `version` (Int, starts at 1)
  - `supersededAt` (DateTime?)
  - `supersededById` (String?)
  - `isLatestVersion` (Boolean)
- **Indexes:** Created for efficient querying
- **Migration:** Created SQL migration file
- **Service Logic:** Replaced hard deletes with versioning
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive guide created

**Files:**
- Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma:787-793`
- Migration: `prisma/migrations/20251001210037_add_invoice_item_versioning/`
- Service: `src/services/invoice.service.ts:456-520`
- Docs: `docs/INVOICE_ITEM_VERSIONING.md`

**Impact:** Complete audit trail, regulatory compliance

---

### 5. Processor Fee Calculation ✅

**Problem:** Hardcoded `processorFee = 0` instead of calculating actual Stripe fees.

**Solution:**
- Created `calculateStripeProcessorFee()` helper function
- Formula: `2.9% + $0.30` per transaction
- Applied to payment creation and webhook processing
- Accurate fee tracking for financial reporting

**Example:**
```typescript
$100.00 payment
→ $2.90 (2.9%) + $0.30 = $3.20 fee
→ $96.80 net amount
```

**File:** `src/services/payment.service.ts:46-56, 140-148, 345-348`

**Impact:** Accurate financial reporting and reconciliation

---

### 6. Payment Overpayment Prevention ✅

**Problem:** No transaction locking on invoice balance updates allowed concurrent overpayments.

**Solution:**
- Wrapped invoice update in `prisma.$transaction()`
- Read-Modify-Write pattern within transaction
- Enhanced error messages with balance details
- **SQLite:** Uses serializable transactions (automatic locking)
- **PostgreSQL:** Ready for `SELECT FOR UPDATE`

**File:** `src/services/invoice.service.ts:796-863`

**Impact:** Prevents race conditions in payment processing

---

### 7. Tax Calculation Precision ✅

**Problem:** Used JavaScript number arithmetic for tax calculations.

**Solution:**
- Imported `decimal.js` library
- All reduce operations use `Decimal.plus()`
- Applied to: subtotal, discounts, taxable amounts, tax totals, grand total
- Ensures accurate Canadian tax calculations (GST/HST/PST/QST)

**File:** `src/services/tax.service.ts:1-4, 114-169`

**Impact:** Prevents tax calculation errors and compliance issues

---

### 8. Password Reset Token Exposure 🔒

**Problem:** Password reset token returned directly in API response, exposing it in logs/network traffic.

**Solution:**
- Email-only token delivery
- Professional HTML + plain text email template
- Generic success message (prevents user enumeration)
- Graceful email service failure handling
- Security warnings in email
- Personalized with user's first name

**File:** `src/services/auth/password.service.ts:260-408`

**Tests:** `tests/unit/password.service.test.ts` (16 comprehensive tests)

**Impact:** Prevents account takeover vulnerabilities

---

### 9. Invoice Item Versioning Implementation ✅

**Problem:** Need proper versioning system for financial record immutability.

**Complete Implementation:**

**Schema Changes:**
```prisma
model InvoiceItem {
  // Versioning fields
  version        Int      @default(1)
  supersededAt   DateTime?
  supersededById String?
  supersededBy   InvoiceItem?
  previousVersions InvoiceItem[]
  isLatestVersion Boolean  @default(true)
}
```

**Migration:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE invoice_items ADD COLUMN version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE invoice_items ADD COLUMN supersededAt DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE invoice_items ADD COLUMN supersededById TEXT;
ALTER TABLE invoice_items ADD COLUMN isLatestVersion BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true;

CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_items_invoice_latest
  ON invoice_items(invoiceId, isLatestVersion);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_items_superseded
  ON invoice_items(supersededById);
```

**Service Logic:**
1. Mark existing items as `isLatestVersion: false`
2. Set `supersededAt` timestamp
3. Create new versions with incremented `version` number
4. Link versions via `supersededById`
5. Never delete records

**Documentation:** Complete guide with examples in `docs/INVOICE_ITEM_VERSIONING.md`

**Impact:**
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Point-in-time reconstruction
- ✅ Regulatory compliance (CRA, SOX, GAAP)

## Performance Impact

### Invoice Item Versioning

**Storage:**
- Current: ~1KB per item
- With versioning: ~1KB × versions
- Example: 5 items × 3 edits = 15 items stored
- Mitigation: Archive after retention period

**Query Performance:**

| Operation | Before | After | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Get current items | Fast | Fast | ✅ Indexed on (invoiceId, isLatestVersion) |
| Get item history | N/A | Fast | ✅ New capability |
| Update items | Fast | ~10% slower | ⚠️ More writes (mark old + create new) |
| Delete items | Fast | N/A | ✅ No longer needed |

**Indexes Added:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_items_invoice_latest
  ON invoice_items(invoiceId, isLatestVersion);

CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_items_superseded
  ON invoice_items(supersededById);
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Invoice Item Versioning Rollback

⚠️ **WARNING:** Destroys complete audit history! Only use as last resort.

```sql
-- Remove versioning fields
ALTER TABLE invoice_items DROP COLUMN version;
ALTER TABLE invoice_items DROP COLUMN supersededAt;
ALTER TABLE invoice_items DROP COLUMN supersededById;
ALTER TABLE invoice_items DROP COLUMN isLatestVersion;

-- Remove indexes
DROP INDEX idx_invoice_items_invoice_latest;
DROP INDEX idx_invoice_items_superseded;

-- Delete historical versions (keep only latest)
DELETE FROM invoice_items WHERE isLatestVersion = false;
```

### Code Rollback

All changes are in version control with clear commit messages:
- Each fix is a separate commit
- Can cherry-pick individual fixes if needed
- Tests verify each component independently

---
