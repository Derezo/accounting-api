## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Schema Mismatches
The seed file has numerous outdated field references that don't match current schema:
- Person/Business require `phone` field
- Account uses `accountCode` not `accountNumber`
- Organization requires `phone` field
- User doesn't have `passwordExpiresAt`, `emailVerified` fields
- InvoiceTemplate doesn't have `isSystem`, `templateType` fields

### 2. Missing Essential Data
- ❌ No audit logs (required for compliance)
- ❌ No journal entries (required for proper accounting)
- ❌ No security events (required for security monitoring)
- ❌ No API keys (required for integrations)

### 3. Incomplete Customer Lifecycle
- Missing public-facing tokens (QuoteAcceptanceToken, AppointmentBookingToken)
- Missing IntakeFormTemplate for lead capture
- Missing notifications/communications

### 4. No Financial Reporting Infrastructure
- Missing JournalEntry for double-entry bookkeeping
- Missing BankAccount/BankTransaction for reconciliation
- Missing TaxRecord for tax reporting

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Existing Seed (Immediate)
1. Add `phone` field to Person creations
2. Add `phone` field to Business creations  
3. Fix any remaining schema mismatches
4. Complete the current seed successfully

### Priority 2: Add Critical Missing Models (High)
1. JournalEntry - Enable proper accounting
2. AuditLog - Enable compliance
3. SecurityEvent - Enable security monitoring
4. IntakeFormTemplate - Enable lead capture
5. QuoteAcceptanceToken - Enable public quotes
6. AppointmentBookingToken - Enable public booking

### Priority 3: Complete Workflow Support (Medium)
1. BankAccount/BankTransaction - Enable reconciliation
2. RecurringInvoice - Enable subscriptions
3. InventoryItem/InventoryTransaction - Enable inventory
4. Employee/EmployeeTimeEntry - Enable payroll
5. Notification/SmsMessage - Enable communications

### Priority 4: System Infrastructure (Low)
1. FeatureToggle - Enable feature flags
2. OrganizationSubscription/SubscriptionPlan - Enable billing
3. Webhook/SystemIntegration - Enable integrations
4. Document/GeneratedPDF - Enable document management

## Conclusion

The current seed file provides **basic operational capability** but is **insufficient for production use**. Critical gaps exist in:
- Accounting infrastructure (no journal entries)
- Compliance (no audit logs)
- Security (no security events)
- Customer workflows (no public tokens)

**Estimated completion: 37% of models, 40% of workflows**
