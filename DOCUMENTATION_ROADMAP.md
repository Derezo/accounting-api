## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **Encryption Activation** - Could impact performance significantly
   - Mitigation: Thorough performance testing before production
   - Rollback plan: Feature flag to disable if issues arise

2. **QuickBooks Integration** - Complex OAuth and API handling
   - Mitigation: Start with read-only sync, gradual feature addition
   - Alternative: Document as "Coming Q1 2026"

3. **ASC 606 Revenue Recognition** - Extremely complex accounting rules
   - Mitigation: Remove from current documentation, plan for 2026
   - Workaround: Manual journal entries for revenue recognition

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **Multi-Currency** - Complex financial calculations
   - Mitigation: Extensive test suite with known scenarios
   - Phased rollout: Enable per-organization opt-in

2. **Inventory Management** - FIFO/LIFO calculations can be complex
   - Mitigation: Start with simple weighted average costing
   - Expansion: Add FIFO/LIFO later if needed

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap prioritizes **documentation honesty** and **incremental feature completion** over maintaining misleading claims of full implementation. The accounting API has strong fundamentals (68% accurate, 88% for core accounting), and this plan brings documentation in line with reality while systematically addressing gaps.

**Immediate Focus (Next 30 Days):**
1. ‚úÖ Update documentation with honest status labels (Week 1)
2. ‚úÖ Verify and document actual test coverage (Week 1)
3. üöß Implement vendor and purchase order system (Weeks 2-4)
4. üöß Activate field-level encryption (Weeks 5-6)

**Long-Term Vision:**
- Achieve 90%+ documentation accuracy by Q2 2026
- Build or document all major third-party integrations
- Reach 85% verified test coverage
- Maintain continuous documentation quality through automation

**Next Review Date:** 2026-01-29 (Quarterly review)
