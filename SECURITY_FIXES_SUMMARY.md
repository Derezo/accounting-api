# Security Fixes Implementation Summary

## Quick Reference

### Files Modified (8 total):

1. **`src/utils/crypto.ts`**
   - Added `validatePasswordStrength()` function
   - Password validation: 12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars

2. **`src/services/auth.service.ts`**
   - Added password history tracking (last 5 passwords)
   - Added password expiration enforcement (90 days)
   - Integrated password validation in register, change, reset flows

3. **`prisma/schema.prisma`**
   - Added `passwordExpiresAt` field to User model
   - Added `PasswordHistory` model with user relation

4. **`src/middleware/rate-limit.middleware.ts`**
   - Added `loginRateLimiter` (5 attempts / 15 min)
   - Added `registerRateLimiter` (3 attempts / hour)
   - Added `passwordResetRateLimiter` (3 attempts / hour)
   - All include security event logging

5. **`src/routes/auth.routes.ts`**
   - Applied rate limiters to auth endpoints
   - Updated documentation with rate limit info

6. **`src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`**
   - Fixed `authorize()` to use role hierarchy
   - SUPER_ADMIN (100) > ADMIN (80) > MANAGER (60) > ACCOUNTANT (50) > EMPLOYEE (40) > VIEWER (20) > CLIENT (10)
   - Test token bypass secured to test environment only

7. **`src/routes/payment.routes.ts`**
   - Added `checkResourceAccess('payment', 'id')` to refund endpoint
   - Added `checkResourceAccess('payment', 'id')` to status endpoint

8. **`src/routes/invoice.routes.ts`**
   - Added `checkResourceOwnership('invoice', 'id')` to update endpoint
   - Added `checkResourceAccess('invoice', 'id')` to cancel endpoint

## Next Steps:

### 1. Database Migration:
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate dev
```

### 2. Regenerate Prisma Client (Already Done):
```bash
npm run prisma:generate  # âœ… Already completed
```

### 3. Test the Changes:
```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run RBAC tests
npm run test:rbac:full
```

### 4. Manual Testing:

#### Password Strength:
```bash
# Should fail - too short
POST /auth/register { password: "Test123!" }

# Should succeed - meets all requirements
POST /auth/register { password: "ValidPass123!@#" }
```

#### Rate Limiting:
```bash
# Make 6 login attempts from same IP
# 6th should return HTTP 429
for i in {1..6}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"wrong"}'
done
```

#### Role Hierarchy:
```bash
# ADMIN should be able to access ACCOUNTANT endpoint
# Previously this would fail, now should succeed
GET /api/v1/organizations/{{orgId}}/financial-statements
Authorization: Bearer {{admin-token}}
```

#### Resource Access:
```bash
# Should fail - payment belongs to different organization
POST /api/v1/organizations/{{orgId}}/payments/{{other-org-payment-id}}/refund
Authorization: Bearer {{admin-token}}
```

## Security Verification Checklist:

- [ ] Verify password validation rejects weak passwords
- [ ] Verify password history prevents reuse of last 5 passwords
- [ ] Verify password expiration after 90 days
- [ ] Verify login rate limit at 5 attempts
- [ ] Verify registration rate limit at 3 attempts
- [ ] Verify password reset rate limit at 3 attempts
- [ ] Verify rate limit security events logged to audit
- [ ] Verify ADMIN can access ACCOUNTANT endpoints
- [ ] Verify MANAGER can access EMPLOYEE endpoints
- [ ] Verify CLIENT cannot access EMPLOYEE endpoints
- [ ] Verify test tokens only work in test environment
- [ ] Verify payment refund checks resource ownership
- [ ] Verify payment status update checks resource ownership
- [ ] Verify invoice update checks creator ownership for EMPLOYEE
- [ ] Verify invoice cancel checks resource access

## Environment Variable Requirements:

Ensure these are properly set in production:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production           # Critical - disables test bypass
JWT_SECRET=<strong-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<strong-secret>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-key>
API_KEY_SALT=<random-salt>
```

## Key Security Improvements:

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Password length | 8+ chars | 12+ chars |
| Password complexity | Basic | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + special |
| Password reuse | Allowed | Blocked (last 5) |
| Password expiration | Never | 90 days |
| Login attempts | Unlimited | 5 per 15 min |
| Registration attempts | Unlimited | 3 per hour |
| Password reset attempts | Unlimited | 3 per hour |
| Role-based access | Exact match only | Hierarchical |
| Resource access checks | Missing | Comprehensive |
| Test mode security | Exposed | Secured |

## Contact for Issues:

If you encounter any problems with these security fixes, check:
