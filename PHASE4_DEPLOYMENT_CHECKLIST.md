## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Database Migration
```bash
# 1. Backup current database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 2. Run Prisma migrations (if any new migrations exist)
npm run prisma:migrate

# 3. Regenerate Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate

# 4. Verify schema integrity
npm run prisma:validate
```

### Phase 2: Build & Deploy
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 2. Run full validation suite
npm run validate:full

# 3. Build production artifacts
npm run build

# 4. Run production tests
NODE_ENV=production npm test

# 5. Deploy to staging environment first
# (Follow your deployment process - Docker, K8s, etc.)
```

### Phase 3: Smoke Testing
After deployment to staging, test critical paths:

1. **Vendor Management**
   ```bash
   # Create vendor
   curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/vendors \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"vendorNumber":"V001","businessId":"{businessId}","category":"SUPPLIES"}'

   # List vendors
   curl https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/vendors \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
   ```

2. **Bill Management**
   ```bash
   # Create bill
   curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/bills \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"vendorId":"{vendorId}","billNumber":"BILL001","billDate":"2025-09-29","dueDate":"2025-10-29","subtotal":1000,"total":1130,"currency":"CAD","lineItems":[...]}'
   ```

3. **Purchase Order Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Create PO
   curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/purchase-orders \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -d '{...}'

   # Approve PO (Manager role required)
   curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/purchase-orders/{poId}/approve \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGER_TOKEN"

   # Receive items
   curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/purchase-orders/{poId}/receive \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -d '{"receivedItems":[...]}'
   ```

4. **Inventory Operations**
   ```bash
   # Create inventory item
   curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/inventory \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -d '{...}'

   # Adjust quantity
   curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/inventory/{itemId}/adjust \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -d '{"adjustmentType":"PURCHASE","quantity":100,"reason":"Initial stock"}'
   ```

### Phase 4: RBAC Validation
Test role-based access control:

```bash
# EMPLOYEE should NOT be able to create vendors (403)
curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/vendors \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EMPLOYEE_TOKEN" \
  -d '{...}'

# ACCOUNTANT CAN create bills (201)
curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/bills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNTANT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{...}'

# ACCOUNTANT CANNOT approve bills (403)
curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/bills/{billId}/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNTANT_TOKEN"

# MANAGER CAN approve bills (200)
curl -X POST https://staging-api/api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/bills/{billId}/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGER_TOKEN"
```

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Tag release
git tag -a v1.4.0 -m "Phase 4: Vendor, Bill, PO, Inventory Management"
git push origin v1.4.0

# 2. Deploy to production
# (Follow your production deployment process)

# 3. Monitor logs for errors
tail -f /var/log/accounting-api/production.log

# 4. Monitor application metrics
# - API response times
# - Error rates
# - Database query performance
```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Rollback

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **API Performance**
   - `/vendors` endpoints: < 200ms response time
   - `/bills` endpoints: < 250ms response time
   - `/purchase-orders` endpoints: < 300ms response time
   - `/inventory` endpoints: < 200ms response time

2. **Error Rates**
   - 4xx errors: < 5% of requests
   - 5xx errors: < 0.1% of requests

3. **Database Performance**
   - Query execution time: < 100ms (95th percentile)
   - Connection pool utilization: < 80%

### Rollback Plan
If critical issues occur:

```bash
# 1. Revert to previous version
git checkout v1.3.0

# 2. Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
# Deploy previous version

# 3. Rollback database migrations (if needed)
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration_name>

# 4. Notify stakeholders
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Validation

- [ ] All 34 endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] RBAC working as expected for all roles
- [ ] Database queries executing within performance SLAs
- [ ] Audit logs recording all create/update/delete operations
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified (organizations can't access each other's data)
- [ ] Validation errors returning proper 400 responses
- [ ] Authentication errors returning 401
- [ ] Authorization errors returning 403

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update API documentation with new endpoints
- [ ] Update role permission matrix
- [ ] Document new business workflows
- [ ] Update integration guide for frontend developers

---

## üìù Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. Vendor and InventoryItem models don't have `createdBy` audit fields (by design)
2. Some pre-existing TypeScript errors in other modules (not related to Phase 4)
3. Purchase order receiving doesn't automatically update inventory (manual process)

### Future Enhancements
1. Automatic inventory updates from PO receiving
2. Advanced inventory valuation methods (FIFO, LIFO, weighted average)
3. Bill payment workflow integration with accounting system
4. Vendor performance analytics and rating system
5. Purchase order approval workflow with multiple approvers
6. Inventory forecasting and reorder point automation
